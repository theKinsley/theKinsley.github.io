### About Me | Hsiao-Yuan, Kinsley, Hsu

I received my master\'s degree from Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology (School of Intelligence and Science Technology, SIST), **Peking University**, and my bachelor\'s degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University.<br>My research interests lie in the fields of **computer vision** and AI-generated content (AIGC), with a primary focus on graphic design generation. In this context, my published papers mainly concentrate on **poster layout generation**.<br>In addition to scientific research, I\'ve also been involved in art promotion for SIST from 2023 to 2025. Feel free to check out a simple [portfolio](hsiaoyuanhsu_portfolio_24.pdf) of my design works if interested.
