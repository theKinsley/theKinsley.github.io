### About Me | Hsiao-Yuan, Kinsley, Hsu

Currently, I am studying for my master\'s degree at **Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology** (School of Intelligence and Science Technology, SIST), **Peking University**. Previously, I received my bachelor\'s degree at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University. My research interests include creativity understanding and generation of visual-textual presentation, mainly focusing on **AI-empowered poster design**. In addition to computer science and technology, I also have a passion for graphic design. This led me to be responsible for the artistic promotion work of SIST in 2023-2025. Feel free to check out a simple [portfolio](hsiaoyuanhsu_portfolio_24.pdf) of my design works if interested.
